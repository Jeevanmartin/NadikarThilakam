# NadikarThilakam üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Stratovate


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Jeevan Martin - Sahrdaya College of Engineering and Technology (SCET)

### Project Description
**NadikarThilakam** is a fun, interactive website where legendary Malayalam actors ‚Äúchat‚Äù with you in a silly, over-the-top style.
Type anything, and watch them respond with quirky, useless, and hilarious one-liners ‚Äî just like a celebrity WhatsApp group gone wild!


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
**The Problem (that doesn‚Äôt exist)**
People everywhere are suffering from a tragic shortage of random, overdramatic, and completely useless celebrity advice.
Life is simply too normal ‚Äî we urgently need famous actors to interrupt our day with irrelevant nonsense to keep reality interesting!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing **NadikarThilakam** ‚Äî the world‚Äôs first platform where actors respond to your questions in the most silly, exaggerated, and utterly unhelpful way possible.
Finally, a website that makes every conversation feel like an over-the-top movie scene‚Ä¶ even when you just asked for the time.


## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (with a WhatsApp-style chat UI for maximum drama).
* **Backend:** Lightweight JavaScript logic (no database, because storing useful info is against the project‚Äôs philosophy).
* **UI Styling:** Custom CSS animations, chat bubbles, and character-specific colors to mimic actor personalities.
* **Image Handling:** Local assets for actor images (loaded randomly per response).
* **Response Logic:** Predefined silly replies triggered per actor, ensuring maximum nonsense and minimal repetition.
* **Hosting:** Static site hosting (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify) for instant and free access to useless fun.
* **Special Feature:** One actor responds at a time, making it feel like a private yet ridiculous conversation.

### Implementation
For Software:

*NadikarThilakam* implemented with the seriousness of a space mission and the usefulness of an umbrella in the desert. Here‚Äôs how it works:

1. **Actor Image Storage** ‚Äì We carefully placed legendary Malayalam actor photos (`fahadh.jpg`, `jagathi.jpg`, `mammootty.jpg`, `mohanlal.jpg`, `suresh gopi.jpg`) inside an `actors` folder, as if they were precious scientific samples.

2. **User Input** ‚Äì The user types any random question, which our system doesn‚Äôt bother to analyze seriously. Instead, it simply counts characters and scolds you in Malayalam if you type too much (`"Enthina mone ithra kooduthal?"`).

3. **Random Actor Selection** ‚Äì For every question, one actor is randomly chosen to ‚Äúrespond‚Äù with a useless yet silly answer, ensuring minimal repetition so you get a variety of star wisdom.

4. **WhatsApp-Style UI** ‚Äì The chat interface is made to look like you‚Äôre secretly texting these actors at 2 AM, and they have nothing better to do than reply to you.

5. **Humorous Logic** ‚Äì No AI model here‚Ä¶ just pure handcrafted nonsense, giving the illusion of intelligence without the burden of actual usefulness.

6. **No Overengineering** ‚Äì Everything runs inside a single `index.html` with a sprinkle of JavaScript and CSS, because the only ‚Äúcloud‚Äù we use is the one outside when it rains.
