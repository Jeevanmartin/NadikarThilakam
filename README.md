# NadikarThilakam üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Stratovate


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Jeevan Martin - Sahrdaya College of Engineering and Technology (SCET)

### Project Description
**NadikarThilakam** is a fun, interactive website where legendary Malayalam actors ‚Äúchat‚Äù with you in a silly, over-the-top style.
Type anything, and watch them respond with quirky, useless, and hilarious one-liners ‚Äî just like a celebrity WhatsApp group gone wild!


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
**The Problem (that doesn‚Äôt exist)**
People everywhere are suffering from a tragic shortage of random, overdramatic, and completely useless celebrity advice.
Life is simply too normal ‚Äî we urgently need famous actors to interrupt our day with irrelevant nonsense to keep reality interesting!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing **NadikarThilakam** ‚Äî the world‚Äôs first platform where actors respond to your questions in the most silly, exaggerated, and utterly unhelpful way possible.
Finally, a website that makes every conversation feel like an over-the-top movie scene‚Ä¶ even when you just asked for the time.


## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (with a WhatsApp-style chat UI for maximum drama).
* **Backend:** Lightweight JavaScript logic (no database, because storing useful info is against the project‚Äôs philosophy).
* **UI Styling:** Custom CSS animations, chat bubbles, and character-specific colors to mimic actor personalities.
* **Image Handling:** Local assets for actor images (loaded randomly per response).
* **Response Logic:** Predefined silly replies triggered per actor, ensuring maximum nonsense and minimal repetition.
* **Hosting:** Static site hosting (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify) for instant and free access to useless fun.
* **Special Feature:** One actor responds at a time, making it feel like a private yet ridiculous conversation.
